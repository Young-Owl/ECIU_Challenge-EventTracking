# ECIU_Challenge-EventTracking
This is the GitHub Repository for any code-example that we used in this challenge. The team is divided in 4 members on which everyone tried to do a basic code to understand the secrets behind AI tracking using OpenCV.

Inside the Pull requests page, there will be other branches from other team members that will later on be merged together in this main branch. There, all members can actively post their results and experiences/issues their having.
